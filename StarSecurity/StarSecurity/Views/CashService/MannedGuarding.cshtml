                Manned guarding is a highly effective way of eliminating criminal damage and theft, making it one of the most proactive security measures that you can take against crime. It is a security service that involves placing security guards at your premises, usually out of hours but sometimes when staff are still present.

                The manned guarding security service that Carter Security offers is much more than a security patrol of your premises. Our security guards are all trained to Security Industry Authority (SIA) standards, and are fitted with body cameras for audible and CCTV footage, ensuring you have a professional security officer managing your property at all times.

                We take the security of your premises very seriously, and our responsibilities will include:
                Front of house access and exit control
                Out of hours reception duties
                Reporting building defects or hazardous areas
                We believe that it is better to be proactive than reactive when it comes to security. It's vital that your assets are protected and your insurance cover is not compromised. We aim to prevent damage, disorder or theft and strive to protect individuals against assault or injury.

                How can our manned guarding security service protect your business?
                We understand that each site will have bespoke requirements, and our security contracts are tailor-made to reflect this.

                For example, you may need your premises to be patrolled every hour; you may require a single security guard and/or teams; or you may require a security guard throughout the night. This is will all be dependent on the size of the site, location and risk. We can also provide individuals that are first aid trained if that is an important factor to you and your business.

                Manned guarding is an excellent step to take in protecting your business. It decreases the opportunity for theft and vandalism, can reduce your insurance costs and our security guards can raise the alarm should an arson attack, or similar, take place at your premises.
